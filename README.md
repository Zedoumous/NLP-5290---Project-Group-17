# NLP - CSCE5290 - Group Project
# Project Group 17

Repository for NLP CSCE5290 group project (Group 17). 

As part of the NLP CSCE5290 course requirements, our team will work on the development, integration, testing, and deployment of a program intended to process resumes and job postings and extract the keywords and skills within those mediums. This program is intended to present to the user keywords in a manner that is efficient and accurate in providing the user useful information about skills or other conveniences that would eliminate the hassle of a user identifying them on their own. The project will feature multiple techniques and methods of information extraction and processing researched and used in the NLP 5290 course.
